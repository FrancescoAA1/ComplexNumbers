# ComplexNumbers
Java Class that operates with Complex Numbers. The repository contains both the main class and the tester.

In order to use the class, clone the repository. After you opened both the classes, compile them using the cmd javac MyComplex.java and javac MyComplexTester.java.
Then use the cmd java MyComplexTester in order to execute the tester program.

If there are any issues with the class, feel free to let me know :)
